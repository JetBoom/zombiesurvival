# Zombie Survival Fixes

Repository containing fixes and enhancements to the Zombie Survival gamemode due to them no longer being publically released or actively merged with the main repo.

New features will not be included in this repo, unless they are needed as part of a fix or for balancing reasons. (No new weapons, zombie classes etc.)

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute. Please ensure that your changes are well documented and refrain from using garry's non standard lua syntax changes as much as possible (Use ``--`` instead of ``//`` for comments, ``not`` instead of ``!`` etc.)

## Installing

For a full guide, see the old readme.txt

All that is required to run the gamemode is to place the zombiesurvival directory into your srcds gamemode directory and then start your server with the ``-gamemode zombiesurvival`` flag.
You can then load any ``zs_*`` map.

## License

The original gamemode is distributed under a custom license (See ``ORIGINAL_LICENSE``). All additional code in this repo is released under the less restrictive GPLv3 (See ``LICENSE``).
