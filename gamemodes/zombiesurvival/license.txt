JBGM LICENSE

VERSION Xx420xX3, 19 January 2015

Copyright © 2013 William Moodhe

Anyone is allowed to copy, upload, or distribute copies of this license, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU license was garbage so I made my own. If you don't like it then feel free to delete the gamemode.
A good portion of people have seen fit to modify stuff I've made, make it so people can "donate" for premium features, and subsequently generate revenue using things that I and others have created without permission. Then they ban members of my Steam groups, DDoS my own servers, openly insult me despite never having talked to me, and be jerks in general.

So I will be issuing DMCA take down notices to server hosts and others who think that I'm joking. Server hosts have typically sided with me during the few times I've needed to do this. I don't plan on being 'that guy' and going after gmod servers trying to stay alive but I do plan on weeding out a few of the bigger jerks out there.

tl;dr - I won't screw with you if you don't screw with me.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
