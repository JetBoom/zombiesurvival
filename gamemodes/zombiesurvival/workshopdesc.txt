A massive gamemode where humans are pit against a zombie horde. All zombies are controlled by actual players instead of NPCs. When a human dies, they become part of the Undead!

Comes with tons of weapons, multiple classes for zombies, boss zombies, an in-depth barricading system, and the new Classic Mode.

WARNING: THIS GAMEMODE WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY FROM THE WORKSHOP. AN UPCOMING GMOD UPDATE IS REQUIRED BEFORE GAMEMODES WORK ON THE STEAM WORKSHOP. IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO HOST A SERVER THEN DOWNLOAD FROM THE SVN. THIS IS ONLY FOR DOWNLOADING CONTENT.
